Chapter 0
AWAKEN!
You suddenly woke up. You look around, in a panic. Nothing is familiar, you are
not wearing your clothes, you are not in your room. It's nighttime, and you are
outside. You notice the pretty steep incline when you stand up. You see a lot of
graves and a weird life-like doll. Before you can do anything, you freeze. The
doll starts speaking, "If you want to live, do what I tell you". After you choose
your class, you will be fighting your first opponent in the arena up the hill.
Chapter 1
Would have been embarrassing getting killed by a mere goblin, so at least you got
that going for you. Now it's time you get some items or upgrades from the shop.
Be sure to be prepared, after leaving the shop, the next battle starts.
