AWAKEN!
You suddenly woke up. You look around, in a panic. Nothing is familiar, you are
not wearing your clothes, you are not in your room. It's nighttime, and you're
outside. You notice the pretty steep incline when you stand up. You see a lot of
graves and a weird life-like doll. Before you can do anything, you freeze. The
doll starts speaking, "If you want to live, do what I tell you".
